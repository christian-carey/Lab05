# SearchBtr
SearchBtr Repository. By Christian Carey. 
SearchBtr is a program that tests the speed differences of binary search vs linear search in different search circumstances. 
This repo contains the cpp file "analyzer", which requires the header file "SpringData.h", and a video demonstrating the pycharm debug windows.
